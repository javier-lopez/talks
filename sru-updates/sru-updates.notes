Hi and welcome to this intro to sru testing, aka testing for proposed updates
my name is Javier LÃ³pez http://wiki.ubuntu.com/~javier-lopez
this session will be practical so prepare your lp id and terminal =)
also, I made some slides, you can fetch from: http://people.ubuntu.com/~javier-lopez/pdf/sru-updates.pdf
if you have any question at any point feel free to ask in the #ubuntu-classroom-chat channel and I'll be glad to answer them
so, to begin
a SRU is a proposed update which has already been accepted in the ubuntu dev version and now is trying to make its way to a stable release (precise, quantal or raring)
not every update is candidate for SRU, to become a SRU an update needs to:
  * fix a severe regression
  * fix a program which loss user data
  * be simple and safe
this page summary all the details: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates
so why stable ubuntu versions have a different policy?
 *stability*
in the past even one liner fixes have brought important issues, bugs #81125, #309674 and #559822 are some examples
so we're trying to ensure updates archived in -updates don't break your computer =)
unfortunately, this policy has an issue
if no one actually test proposed updates are good enough those update will stay at -proposed for ever
a complete list of current -proposed updates are here: http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/pending-sru.html
as you can see, there are updates for all stable releases, lucid, precise, quantal and raring, once saucy gets released, updates will appear here before they get distributed to everyone
blue and green updates are optimal to test
so, now we'll test a couple of them
you'll need:
 * any stable ubuntu release, I'll asume raring for this example
 * a lp account
 * optionally, pbuilder, virtualbox or a spare machine
if you don't have a lp account you can create one in a couple of minutes: https://launchpad.net/+login
now, let's review some of the pending updates: http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/pending-sru.html
as you can see, there are plenty of opportunities to help
however for now we'll focus on software-properties, specifically
bug #1047424
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/software-properties/+bug/1047424
this report was opened to fix a problem with the additional drivers dialog
reports related to a sru are exceptional good, so it's generally easy to follow instructions
if they're not clear enough then you can put a comment in the report and add the tag: 'verification-failed'
the 'test case' section is specially helpful try to not overlook it
before going further, I recommend to upgrade the system
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
I'll wait a couple of minutes for those willing to follow
alright, now that we have an updated system, we're gonna see if the problem is
still there (when the button 'restart' is pressed the system halts instead of rebooting)
we can look for 'drivers' directly in the dash and select 'Software & Updates'
after opening it, we can click the latest tab 'Additional Drivers' and install
or remove a driver, let's do it
after selecting one driver we can press 'Apply changes'
that will triage the process
please let me know when you've completed the step =)
alright, I think we can continue
now, a 'Restart...' button should appear.., click on it
a dialog asking for confirmation will appear, and it'll only have 'cancel' and
'shutdown' as options, click 'cancel'
instead of that dialog, a restart dialog should appear, so we've found the issue!
after confirming the error, we can apply the -proposed update and see if that
fix the problem, detailed instructions are here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/EnableProposed
the safest way to do it IMO is to modify /etc/apt/sources.list directly
if you don't feel like reading the wiki right now, you can trust me and run:
$ echo 'deb http://mx.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring-proposed main restricted multiverse universe' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/proposed.list
after adding the proposed repository the system needs to update the index and apply the updates
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install software-properties-gtk
now, it's time to retry the dialog to see if it's been fixed
close the software-properties dialog, and reopen it
once open, go to the driver tab and select the 'Restart ...' button
this time a reboot dialog should be shown, how many saw this dialog?
you guys are awesome! =)!, that's exactly what SRU testing is about
so, once we've tested and confirm that the proposed update fixes the reported
issue, we can add comments, those who completed the sru testing, please do so
it's also a nice idea to add the 'verification-done' tag
so, that's it for now, a member of the SRU team will look at the comment and
hopefully will aprove and copy the requested update to the -updates repository
if you've any trouble going throug a further sru update, please don't hesitate to ask
on #ubuntu-quality or to me if I'm around =P
thank you for your time, that's all for me =)
